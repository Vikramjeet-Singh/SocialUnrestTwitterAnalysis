    "The **Twitter Search API** only returns results from the last 7 days. This means that if you are using Tweepy to search for anything - a word, a phrase, or a hashtag - you'll only get recent results. \n",
    "\n",
    "This *does not* apply to using the API to access a user's Tweets. Therefore, if your data mining is based on collecting tweets from a set of users, then you can obtain results older than 7 days, as long as you are getting tweets from timelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'm going to introduce a Python module called ``got3`` that allows you to executes searches for Tweets at any date range. It's a clever application of web scraping (which we discussed briefly in a previous lecture) where you emulate visiting the website, download the HTML, and extract specific results. Since, strangely enough, the *browser version* of search *does* allow searching for older tweets, the ``got3`` emulates visiting the browser search bar, \"executes\" a search per your parameters, and scrapes the results. In the Python environment, you get tweet objects that you can manipulate and store as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to use ``got3``, then you can \"experiment\" using [Twitter's browser search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en). If you can generate a set of criteria on Twitter's browser search that gets the tweets you need, then you can configure ``got3`` to get those tweets as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things we need to do to get ``got3`` working on our systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there's another library that is a dependency of ``got3``. It's called ``pyquery``. In your command line/terminal window, install ``pyquery`` with the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pyquery\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it's time to \"install\" ``got3`` itself. Unfortunately, ``got3`` is not available through ``pip``, the Python library manager we have been relying on all this time. Instead, we simply have to *put* the ``got3`` files in the right location. On Canvas, there is a zip file you can download. Unzip it, and put the entire directory (which is named ``got3``) in the directory from which you launch Python. As long as it's there, we're all set. "
